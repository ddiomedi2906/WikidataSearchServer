# IMGpedia - Index Search

Index Search project for looking relevant images for a certain keyword (ex: Chile, Obama, Machu Pichu, etc). 
This project is mainly done using Java, Apache Lucene and the server is build using Java Servlet and Tomcat. 
The code for building the indexes are strongly based on the Lucene lab code of the Big Data course teached by Aidan Hogan.

## Requirements:
- Java 8
- Apache Lucene 4.8.1
- Tomcat 8.5.35
- Gson 2.8.5

## About project
- The search API is build using Java Servlet as you can check in com.search.ShalomServlet.java. It is possible to deploy just this APi and use other tools for getting the search results.
- The front-end is implemented using JavaServer pages (jsp files) where you can see web.index.jsp. Also it has Bootstrap for css style.
- There are other utils files in utils folder for render html and search using a Lucene index.

## How to run it
(This only apply if you have an account in PRISMA machine, otherwise just look how to run a Tomcat server)
